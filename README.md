# Game-of-life

The code (here, wrote it in Python) is based on a simple mathematical logic called the Game of Life or just Life, invented by British mathematician John Conway, building on another famous mathematician John Von Neumann's concept of populating other planets with self-reproducing machines. For example, machines sent to Mars would dig up iron ore (Fe2O3) and extract the iron to make replicas of itself, releasing oxygen in the process, thus making it a habitable planet. This game is driven by initial conditions. There are no runtime controls, as the game plays itself.
